# Satellite-tracker
A Real-time satellite tracker

it's in the name ! it basically let's u track the international space station's position in real time.

this being one of my first takes on working with api's, i've done a simple front end app, which is why i cannot deploy it on a proper domain, for a cleaner version,
check my other project called Satellite-tracker in which i won't only track the ISS but a whole lot of other satellites with the use of the N2YO api
